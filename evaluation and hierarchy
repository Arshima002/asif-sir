[C] Expression Evaluation and Hierarchy 

Expression: 

c 

g = big / 2	big	/ big - big + abc / 3 

Substitute: 

abc = 2.5, big = 2 

Expression becomes: 

g	2 / 2 + 	4 /	2 + 2 . 5 / 3 

Step-by-step evaluation: 

1 . 2 / 2 

8 / 2 = 4 

2 . 5 / 3 = 0.833. . . 

so g	2 + 0.833. . . = 3.833. . . 

Hierarchy (operator precedence): 

• / and * have higher precedence than + and • Left to right associativity for all of these
